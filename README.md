#  Beer Card Tracker

A simple, responsive React app to track and review your favorite beers. Users can add beers with key details like type, ABV, rating, and description — then view them in a mobile-friendly grid layout.

I started this project on Angular years ago and decided to re-create and finish this in React. 

## Features

-  Create beer cards with:
  - Name
  - Type (Lager, IPA, Stout, etc.)
  - ABV (Alcohol by Volume)
  - Personal rating (0–10)
  - Description
  - "Added by" field
